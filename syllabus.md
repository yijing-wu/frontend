# Course Syllabus: INFO 6150 - Seattle
# Fall Semester 2021 - Fri
Instructor: Brett Ritter `<b.ritter@neu.edu>`

This course covers the essentials of front-end web development in terms of User Interaction/User Experience (UI/UX).  This will NOT teach you to be a designer, but will give you the building blocks to work with designers (or decide you want to learn more about Human/Computer Interaction (HCI).  It will also not teach you all the steps to perform full web development (see INFO6250 for that) but will give you the basis to be effective at UI/UX design for web development if you are so inclined.
