# Todo App using services

Important Note:
- You must run your front end code (using `npm start` or serving the static-built files using `serve` or another webserver) 
- AND you must run the service code (in a separate terminal, see the sample `services-for-todo`)
  - both run with `npm start` in their respective directories
  - you will need to run `npm install` once each

Unless both servers are running this code will fail!
