# Assignment - Basic Form

**Due: Thu Oct 6, 11:59pm PT** 

# Goal

You will create an HTML page and matching CSS file that can be served using `npx serve` in this directory.

The page should include the following: 
 - an image "logo" (school-appropriate image of your choice)
 - visible page title
 - a menu bar with drop down menus that use transition or animation
   - The menu must be clearly a menu - this was not explicitly shown in class!
   - there must be at least two options with dropdowns  
   - as you scroll down over a submenu, the individual choices should be highlighted
 - There should be some text of your choice as page content
 - There should be a visible footer section with some text of your choice in it

You will be graded on:

- Does the CSS show some form of organization?  (label a few areas in comments to let us know the convention)
- Does the menu work for both mouse and keyboard navigation?
- Does the menu work well with the page? (do areas line up?  Are selections and animations smooth?)
- Does the page work well? (does the page have clear sections without any parts that look odd?  Are the color combinations better than shown in class? Do you have awkward borders/sections/highlighting/animation?)
- Have you demonstrated an understanding of the skills taught in class?
- Are you following the best practices as described by this course?
