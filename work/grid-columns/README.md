# Assignment - Grid Columns

**Due: Thu Dec 2, 11:59pm PT** 

# Goal

You will fill in the matching stylesheet for the provided HTML so that the rendered page matches the provided mockup image (differences due to browser window size are expected - your page should work for a wide range of desktop window sizes, but is not expected to work at mobile sizes yet).

# Requirements

- Do not modify the html file
- Use a 12 column grid using css grids to layout the divisions shown
- All padding/margin/gap values are 0.25rem, 0.5rem, or 1rem, not pixel based.
  - the h2 is Chrome defaults for margins/padding/font-size
- The colors used are all named colors: skyblue or lightblue
- You can view the file using either `File->Open File` in Chrome or by serving the page by using `npx serve` in this directory and visiting `http://localhost:5000/homepage.html` in the browser.
- The links are not going to work if you follow them - that's fine, they are not part of the assignment.
- Notice the header is NOT aligned to the 12 column grid - it is based on the width of the image
- Notice the links in the footer are aligned with the 12 column grid
- Notice the footer fills the page before "the fold"
- Notice the "Read More" "buttons" are horizontally aligned, even when the text above doesn't wrap
  - This is done using a margin-top: auto trick, similar to how we can use margin-left: auto in a flexbox row to push an item to the far right
